**#Steps to run the Project**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Open the folder in any IDE(Preferrably VS Code)

2. Ensure that python,django and django rest framework installed in it.

3. If it is not installed then simply down python from the official website and you install django and DRF from the terminal      using pip(pip install django).

4. After that write a command (python manage.py runserver).This will make project running on the localhost.

5. When you enter the local host page not found will be shown. So simply hit (localhost:8000/home/).At this url all the api's     will be present i.e. users(which will show all the users),register(make registration),spam(mark it spam),search(search any name using phone_no).

6.  Make sure you have downloaded POSTMAN for API testing whether it is working or not.
